Let's explore how you can set up the repo on your local machine and start contributing!

This section requires some existing knowledge of [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/).

### Getting the repo

For OSS contributions, we use a [Forking Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow), meaning each developer will fork the repo and work on their own fork; and then submit a PR to the main repo when they're ready to merge their changes.

To begin:

1. [Create a fork](https://github.com/thirdweb-dev/engine/fork) of this repository to your own GitHub account.

2. [Clone your fork](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) to your local device.

3. Create a new branch on your fork to start working on your changes:

   ```
   git checkout -b MY_BRANCH_NAME
   ```

4. Install the dependencies:
   ```
   yarn install
   ```

Now you have got the repo on your local machine, and you're ready to start making your changes!
